# ai_language_tutor

This project builds an interactive, culturally sensitive AI language tutor in Google Colab using open-source technologies. It combines:

Flan-T5 (from Google) for multilingual phrase understanding

Whisper or Google Translate for basic language translation

Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) for audio playback

The notebook is intended for learners of any native language to explore and practice culturally relevant phrases while learning a target language (like German).

## Key Features

✏️ Translation support (e.g., Hindi → German)

🎤 Speech synthesis in both native and target language using gTTS

👩‍🎓 Flan-T5-based explanation of target phrases in English

🤔 AI-generated multiple choice quizzes based on native/target pairs
